        Here''s the thing.
        
        
        I could a book and find that the arguments in the book are "valid" - that it is
        impossible, or at least unlikely, that the premises are true and the conclusion
        false. However, what I can''t do by reading is determine if the premises are true.
        
        
        In the infamous <i>Alien Autopsy</i> "documentary", there were three specific
        claims made for the authenticity of the video.
        
        
        1) An expert from Kodak examined the film, and verified that it is as old as was
        claimed.
        
        2) A pathologist was interviewed, who said that the autopsy portrayed was done
        in the manner that an actual autopsy would have been done.
        
        3) An expert from Spielberg''s movie studio testified that modern special effects
        could not duplicate the scenes in the video.
        
        
        If you accept these statements as true, it becomes reasonable to accept that the
        footage was actually showing what it appeared to show; an autopsy of dead aliens.
        
        
        Upon seeing these claims, though, my response was along the lines of <a href="/lw/ig/i_defy_the_data/">"I
        defy the data."</a> As it turns out, all three of those statements were <b>blatant
        lies</b>. There was no expert from Kodak who verified the film. Kodak offered
        to verify the film, but was denied access. Many other pathologists said that the
        way the autopsy was performed in the film was absurd, and that no competent pathologist
        would ever do an autopsy on an unknown organism in that manner because it would
        be completely useless. The person from Spielberg''s movie studio was selectively
        quoted and was very angry about it. What he really said that the film was good
        for whatever grade B studio happened to have produced it.
        
        
        I could read your book, but I believe that it is more likely that the statements
        in the book are wrong than it is that psi exists. As Thomas Jefferson <a href="http://www.astro.virginia.edu/class/skrutskie/astr121/notes/jefferson.html">did
        not say</a>, "It is easier to believe that two Yankee professors [Profs. Silliman
        and Kingsley of Yale] would lie than that stones would fall from the sky."
        
        
        The burden of proof is on you, Matthew. Many, many claims of the existence of
        "psi" have been shown to be bogus, so I give further claims of that nature very
        little credence. Either tell us about a repeatable experiment - copy a few paragraphs
        from that book if you have to - or we''re going to ignore you.
