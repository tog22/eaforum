Test plans for automatic wiki account creation/association.

* Setup [0%]
  - [ ] noemail: user without an email address pwnoemail
  - [ ] bobtest: user with verified email address pwbobtest bobtest@mailinator.com
  - [ ] iamslow: user with verified email address pwiamslow iamslow@mailinator.com
  - [ ] __frodo: user with verified email address pw__frodo frodo@mailinator.com
  - [ ] ihavewiki: user with a wiki account on staging called "ihavewiki" pwihavewiki ihavewiki@mailinator.com
  - [ ] create wiki account on staging called "new_ihavewiki" pwnew_ihavewiki

Remark: you will need to disassociate accounts and remove their email
addresses for some of these. Use a paster shell and run things like:

from r2.models import Account
a = Account._by_name('noemail')
a.email = None
a.email_validated = False
a._commit()
for name in ['bobtest', 'iamslow', 'ihavewiki']:
  a = Account._by_name(name)
  a.wiki_account = None
  a.wiki_association_attempted_at = None
  a._commit()

You will also need to remove wiki accounts to test
auto-association. Use scripts/deleteTestAccounts.php from the lesswrong
repository.
